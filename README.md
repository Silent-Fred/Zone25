# Zone25
A very reduced implementation of a timer for the "Pomodoro" technique.

## How it works
Tap "Start" to start a series of four "pomodori". Each lasts 25 minutes, followed by a five
minute break. After the last one, you should take a break of at least 15 minutes.

Tap "Stop" if you don't want to finish all the "pomodori".

You'll be notified about the end of a "pomodoro" or a break.

## What it does NOT do
No statistics for "self-improvement". Focus on the work to do, not the app.

No "time-left" is displayed. Don't rush. Focus on the work to do, not the app.

Anything else you might have expected.
